# cheerilee.el

cheerilee.el is a toolkit library for the X Window System, written in Emacs Lisp.
It is a presentation system, in the same spirit of the DOM or WPF.
Events are handled by other ELisp functions, by attaching them to the defined elements.

It uses the [XELB](https://github.com/ch11ng/xelb) library to communicate with the X server.
